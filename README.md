# TranqRotate

This addon is meant to help hunters to setup tranqshot rotation and give them real time visual feedback about it.

This first version is missing a lot of features I want to implement, and will only let you configure automatic success and miss tranqshot announces to a defined channel, hopefully you won't have to bother with that crappy macro anymore !

## Roadmap

Here is a list of feature I want to implement at some point, no specific order is decided yet.

- Display of hunter's tranqhot cooldowns
- Transhot rotation configuration (raid assist required, order hunters, make groupe of multiple hunters, leave some hunt out of rotation as backup)
- Transhot rotation display (Synchronized list will rotate as hunters tranq successfully or miss, showing at top the next hunter or hunter group that will have to tranq)

### About me

I work as developer in a very different field, I have been wanting to make some addon for a long time but I'm a total newbie on this topic.

Here is my first try, don't be too harsh but let me know if somethings looks wrong to you !
